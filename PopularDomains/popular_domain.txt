popular_domain.py script takes list of email addresses as input and return list of 10 most pupolar domains

We can improve this programme by file name as a command line argument like
$  python popular_domain.py email.txt
 need to import sys module(from sys imoprt argv) and change line 8 to filename = argv[1]
